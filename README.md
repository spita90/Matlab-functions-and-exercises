# Matlab-functions-and-exercises

A list of fully functional MATLAB functions and exercises for Numerical Calculation.
We space from LaGrange interpolations to Gauss matrix inversion, and from Newton tangent method, to machine precision testing, and so on...

Feel free to try it yourself!

Please, to do so, be sure to place all files in the same directory, because some exercises are dependant on some (included) functions.
